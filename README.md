## Project Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * Git
  * Python 3.8+

### 2\. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parthpawer/Library-Management-System.git
cd library_project
```

### 3\. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment (e.g., named 'temp')
python -m venv temp

# Activate it
# On Windows:
temp\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source temp/bin/activate
```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5\. Set Up Environment Variables

This project uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive information and configuration.

**a.** Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.

**b.** Copy the following content into it and fill in your desired values.

```env
# Flask and Database Configuration
SECRET_KEY="a_super_secret_key_that_is_long_and_random"
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///library.db"

# Initial Admin User
ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@example.com"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin_password_123"

# Initial Librarian User
LIBRARIAN_USERNAME="librarian1"
LIBRARIAN_EMAIL="librarian@example.com"
LIBRARIAN_PASSWORD="librarian_password_123"

# Initial Book Categories (comma-separated)
INITIAL_BOOK_TYPES="Learning,Movie,Magazine,Novel,Comic"
```

### 6\. Create Seed Data File

The initial book data is loaded from a JSON file. Create a file named `seed_books.json` in the root directory and add your book data to it.

```json
[
  {
    "title": "The Great Gatsby",
    "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    "isbn": "9780743273565",
    "publisher": "Scribner",
    "description": "A novel set in the Jazz Age on Long Island.",
    "price": 15.99,
    "cost_per_day": 0.5,
    "genre_id": 1,
    "book_type_id": 4,
    "image": null
  },
  {
    "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
    "author": "Harper Lee",
    "isbn": "9780061120084",
    "publisher": "J.B. Lippincott & Co.",
    "description": "A novel about racial injustice in the Deep South.",
    "price": 12.99,
    "cost_per_day": 0.4,
    "genre_id": 1,
    "book_type_id": 4,
    "image": "mockingbird.jpg"
  }
]
```

### 7\. Run the Application

Now, you can run the application. The code will automatically create and seed the database file (`instance/library.db`) on the first run.

```bash
python run.py
```

The application will be available at **[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)**.
